					Hi there üëãüèæ, my name's Tristan, and I'm the creator of AiGrub.
				</Typography>
				<Typography paragraph gutterBottom>
					After{" "}
					<a href="https://chat.openai.com/" target="_blank">
						OpenAi's 's ChatGPT-3
					</a>{" "}
					took the world by storm in December 2022, I decided to see what all
					fuss was about.

				<Typography paragraph gutterBottom>
					This app stems from my explorations into their documentation, a wicked
					Spotify playlist, and likely too much caffeine.

				<Typography paragraph gutterBottom>
					If you enjoyed this app and want to say hi, please reach out to{" "}
					<a href="mailto:contact@tristandeane.ca">contact@tristandeane.ca</a>.
				</Typography>
				<Typography paragraph gutterBottom>
					Otherwise, I'm always open to boosting my meager LinkedIn following
					here:{" "}

					>
						My LinkedIn

					Finally, you can find more of my work on my site:{" "}
